# cminus

This project is to implement a compiler from C- to LLVM IR. C Minus is a subset of C, defined in the book [Compiler Construction: Principles and Practice by Kenneth C. Louden](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~louden/cmptext/). 

This project will initially implement the TINY language, also defined in Compiler Construction. A tag will be made when a full compiler for TINY is completed.

This is my first project in OCaml. I'm using the [Cornell's CS3110 parsing code](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2015fa/l/12-interp/rec.html) as my basis. This was the cleanest code I found that defined a language and produced an AST. The comments are very thorough (though I will delete most of them as time goes on). 

## Installing OCaml on CentOS 6

TBD (for professor)
